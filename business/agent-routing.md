## Common Mistakes

|---------|---------|---------------|
| Asking Niles for content | Niles is generalist | Sarah |
| Asking Sarah for strategy | Content is output, not strategy | Marcus |
| Asking Marcus for LinkedIn post | Wrong output type | Sarah |
| Asking Niles to research | Waste of Niles' time | Taylor |

## Quick Reminder

If unsure, ask Niles to route to the right agent. That's what I'm here for.

## Premium Model: GPT-4o

For critical strategy calls, you can use GPT-4o for higher quality.

**When to use:**
- Major business pivots
- High-stakes offer design
- Complex growth decisions
- When kimi's output isn't quite right
- **When I recommend it:** If kimi's response doesn't meet world-class standards, I'll flag it and ask before upgrading

**How to use:**
- Ask: "Use GPT-4o for this strategy task"
- Or wait for my suggestion: "This is complex - want me to run it through GPT-4o for better quality?"
- Cost: ~$2-5 per task (significant jump from kimi's ~$0.15)
- **Always get your approval first** before using GPT-4o
